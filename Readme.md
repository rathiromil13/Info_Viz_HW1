# HW-1


## Solution 1:

My score in quiz was 4/13. I think I was being pessimist regarding a lot of questions especially regarding Population Distribution and Life Expectancy.

Overall, many questions were interesting. I decided to explore the population distribution across countries and continents and vizualize it. The question was regarding the distribution of population around major continents.

Being home to two most populous country, currently Asia was expected to be the country with highest population but on looking at distribution, it shows that majority of population resides only in India and China. Leaving these two countries aside, overall population is considerable low.


I also decided to explore Population Density, to my surprise,:
(i) Africa has the lowest population density
(ii) Europe and Asia are very close in terms of average population density.

To perform this, I merged the countries from Population File to their original name from Company Entity File. Then it was filtered to find population for current year.

Then data was aggregated to get total population, mean population density.
